About NURBS:


  Non-Uniform Rational B-Splines (NURBS) curves and surface 
  are parametric functions which can represent any type of curves 
  or surfaces.
  Some reasons for the use of NURBS are, that they: [PIEGL][ROGERS]

     -offer one common mathematical form for both, standard analytical shapes (e.g. conics) and free form shapes;
     -provide the flexibility to design a large variety of shapes;
     -can be evaluated reasonably fast by numerically stable and accurate algorithms;
     -are invariant under affine as well as perspective transformations;
     -are generalizations of non-rational B-splines and non-rational and rational Bezier curves and surfaces.
